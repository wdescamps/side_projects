Fortunately, there’s a solution: we can put each of the note objects into a List which is a built in Python object that stores multiple other objects (like Notes or Chords, or even things like numbers). To create a list in Python, put square brackets ([]) around the things that you want to put in the list, separated by commas. Let’s create a list called noteList that contains note1 and note2:"

    "A critical feature of music21’s design that distinguishes it from other music analysis frameworks is that one music21 object can be simultaneously stored (or, more accurately, referenced) in more than one Stream. For examples, we might have numerous Measure Streams contained in a Part Stream. If we extract a region of this Part (using the measures() method), we get a new Stream containing the specified Measures and the contained notes. We have not actually created new notes within these extracted measures; the output Stream simply has references to the same objects. Changes made to Notes in this output Stream will be simultaneously reflected in Notes in the source Part. There is one limitation though: the same object should not appear twice in one hierarchical structure of Streams. For instance, you should not put a note object in both measure 3 and measure 5 of the same piece – it can appear in measure 3 of one piece and measure 5 of another piece. (For instance, if you wanted to track a particular note’s context in an original version of a score and an arrangement). Most users will never need to worry about these details: just know that this feature lets music21 do some things that no other software package can do."
