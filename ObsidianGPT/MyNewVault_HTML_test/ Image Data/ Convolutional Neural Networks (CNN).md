**Model Type:**  Computer Vision Models
**Data Type:**  Image Data

## Use Cases :

a) Image classification: CNNs can identify and categorize objects within images with high accuracy. This is a core task in many computer vision applications, such as autonomous vehicles, medical imaging, and surveillance systems.

b) Object detection: CNNs can find and localize multiple objects within an image, making them suitable for applications in which detecting and recognizing objects of interest is required, such as traffic monitoring, retail analytics, and facial recognition.

c) Semantic segmentation: CNNs can also be used to label each pixel of an image with a class, which provides a detailed understanding of the scene. This is useful in fields like autonomous navigation, where understanding the delineation of objects like roads, sidewalks, and pedestrians is crucial.


## Python code: 

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

# Load and preprocess the dataset
mnist = tf.keras.datasets.mnist
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()
x_train, x_test = x_train[..., tf.newaxis] / 255.0, x_test[..., tf.newaxis] / 255.0

# Build the CNN model
model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)),
    Conv2D(64, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5)

# Evaluate the model
model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
```

This code snippet uses TensorFlow to create a simple CNN model for the image classification task. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which contains images of handwritten digits. The CNN consists of two convolutional layers, followed by two max-pooling layers, a fully connected layer, and the output layer. The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and is trained on the training set for five epochs. Finally, the performance of the model is evaluated on the test set.
