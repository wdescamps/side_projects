**Model Type:**  Classification Models
**Data Type:**  Numerical Data

## Use Cases :

a. Classification Problems: XGBoost can be employed for binary or multi-class classification tasks, such as spam detection, sentiment analysis, or customer segmentation.

b. Regression Problems: XGBoost can be used for linear, non-linear, or time-series regression problems, such as predicting house prices, forecasting sales, or estimating energy consumption.

c. Feature Importance and Selection: XGBoost offers built-in feature importance scores, making it useful for reducing the dimensionality of high-dimensional datasets or finding the most relevant features for a given problem.


## Python code: 

```python
import xgboost as xgb
from sklearn.datasets import load_boston
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Load the Boston Housing dataset
boston = load_boston()
X, y = boston.data, boston.target

# Split the data into a train and test set
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Instantiate the XGBRegressor model
xgboost_model = xgb.XGBRegressor(
    objective='reg:squarederror',
    n_estimators=100,
    learning_rate=0.1,
    max_depth=3,
    random_state=42
)

# Train the model
xgboost_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = xgboost_model.predict(X_test)

# Calculate the mean squared error
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print("Mean Squared Error: ", mse)
```

This example demonstrates how to use XGBoost for a regression problem, specifically predicting house prices in the Boston Housing dataset. The code demonstrates how to load the dataset, split it into a train and test set, instantiate the XGBRegressor model, train the model, make predictions, and evaluate the performance using the mean squared error metric.
