**Model Type:**  Regression Models
**Data Type:**  Numerical Data

## Use Cases :

a. Predicting house prices: Gradient Boosting Regression can be used to predict the price of residential properties based on various features such as neighborhood, number of rooms, property size, etc.

b. Sales forecasting: In retail and e-commerce, Gradient Boosting Regression can be used to model and forecast future sales based on historical data, promotions, holidays, and other relevant features.

c. Predicting customer lifetime value (CLV): Gradient Boosting Regression can be used to predict the total revenue a company can expect from a customer, considering customer usage patterns, demographics, and other factors.


## Python code: 

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.datasets import load_boston
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor

# Loading the dataset
boston = load_boston()
data = pd.DataFrame(boston.data, columns=boston.feature_names)
targets = boston.target

# Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data, targets, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Creating a Gradient Boosting Regressor and fitting it to the training data
gbm = GradientBoostingRegressor(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1, max_depth=3, random_state=42)
gbm.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predicting test data and calculating the mean squared error
y_pred = gbm.predict(X_test)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)

print('Mean Squared Error:', mse)
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to use the Gradient Boosting Regressor implemented in scikit-learn to predict house prices using the Boston Housing dataset. After the model is trained, we evaluate its performance on the held-out test set using mean squared error as the evaluation metric.
