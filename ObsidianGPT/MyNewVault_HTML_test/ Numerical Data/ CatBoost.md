**Model Type:**  Classification Models
**Data Type:**  Numerical Data

## Use Cases :

a. Binary Classification: CatBoost can be used to distinguish between two classes, like determining whether a customer will make a purchase or not.

b. Multiclass Classification: It can predict outcomes for multiple classes, such as classifying different species of plants based on their features.

c. Regression: The CatBoost model can also be used to predict continuous numeric outcomes, such as predicting house prices based on various factors.


## Python code: 

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from catboost import CatBoostClassifier, Pool
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv('data_file.csv')  # replace 'data_file.csv' with your data file

# Preprocess data, extract features and labels
X = data.drop('target_column', axis=1) # replace 'target_column' with the column representing labels in your dataset
y = data['target_column']

# Split the data into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Identify categorical features
cat_features = np.where(X_train.dtypes == np.object)[0]

# Initialize CatBoost Classifier
model = CatBoostClassifier(learning_rate=0.1, n_estimators=100)

# Train the model with categorical features as input
model.fit(X_train, y_train, cat_features=cat_features)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Calculate and print the accuracy of the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("Accuracy: {:.2f}%".format(accuracy * 100))
```
Replace 'data_file.csv' with the path of your dataset and 'target_column' with the specific column representing labels in the dataset. This code assumes that you have categorical features present in the dataset, but will also work with numeric or combined features. Don't forget to install the CatBoost library using 'pip install catboost' before running the code.
