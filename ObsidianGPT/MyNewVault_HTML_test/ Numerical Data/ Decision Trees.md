**Model Type:**  Classification Models
**Data Type:**  Numerical Data

## Use Cases :

a) Classification: Decision Trees can be applied to problems like customer churn prediction, spam detection, or medical diagnosis, where the objective is to classify the data into different categories.

b) Regression: For continuous target variables, Decision Trees can be used to predict house prices, stock prices, or energy consumption, among other things.

c) Feature Selection: Decision Trees can be used to rank the importance of input features in a dataset, which is useful when selecting a subset of features for building more complex models.


## Python code: 
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load the iris dataset
data = load_iris()

# Create pandas dataframe
iris_df = pd.DataFrame(data=data.data, columns=data.feature_names)

# Add target variable to the dataframe
iris_df["target"] = data.target

# Split the dataset into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    iris_df[data.feature_names], iris_df["target"], random_state=42
)

# Create a Decision Tree classifier 
classifier = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=3, random_state=42)

# Train the classifier on the training data
classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test data
y_pred = classifier.predict(X_test)

# Calculate the accuracy of the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
```
This code demonstrates the use of a Decision Tree model for classification on the well-known Iris dataset. It uses the scikit-learn library for loading the dataset, splitting the data, creating the classifier, and measuring the model's accuracy. The model's maximum depth is set to 3 to limit the complexity of the tree.
