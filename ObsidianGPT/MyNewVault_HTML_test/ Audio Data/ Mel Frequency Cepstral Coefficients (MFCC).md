**Model Type:**  Speech Recognition Models
**Data Type:**  Audio Data

## Use Cases :

a. Speech recognition: MFCC is a widely used feature in training automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems for recognizing words, phrases, or sentences in spoken language.

b. Speaker recognition: It is employed in speaker identification and verification systems for determining the identity of a speaker or confirming whether a speaker is who they claim to be.

c. Audio classification: MFCC can be leveraged to classify music genres, identify emotions in speech, or detect environmental sounds in various applications such as smart home systems or security monitoring.


## Python code: 

```python
import librosa
import numpy as np

def extract_mfcc(audio_file, n_mfcc=12):
    # Load the audio file and compute the MFCC features
    y, sr = librosa.load(audio_file)
    mfcc_features = librosa.feature.mfcc(y=y, sr=sr, n_mfcc=n_mfcc)

    return mfcc_features


# Sample usage
audio_file_path = 'example.wav' # Replace with your own audio file
mfcc_features = extract_mfcc(audio_file_path)
print("MFCC features shape:", mfcc_features.shape)
print("MFCC features for the first frame:\n", mfcc_features[:, 0])
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to extract MFCC features from an audio file using the `librosa` library. Replace `'example.wav'` with the path to your own audio file to see the results. The extracted MFCC features can be further utilized for various applications such as speech recognition, speaker identification, or audio classification.
