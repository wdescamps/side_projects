**Model Type:**  Music Generation Models
**Data Type:**  Audio Data

## Use Cases :

a. Game playing: MCTS has been used extensively in computer game playing, particularly in board games like Go, Chess, and Hex, where the state space is large and it can find good moves without exhaustive search.

b. Planning and optimization: MCTS can be applied to stochastic optimization problems, such as robot motion planning, job scheduling, and vehicle routing, where the objective is generated randomly, and the algorithm must explore an unknown landscape.

c. Artificial intelligence research: MCTS shows promise in the field of AI systems that can learn to succeed in complex environments, and it has been used in reinforcement learning, neural networks, and multi-agent systems research.


## Python code: 

In this example, we'll use the 'MCTS' Python library linked earlier to implement MCTS for the game of Tic-Tac-Toe.

```python
import numpy as np
from mcts.node import MCTSNode
from mcts.game import MCTSGame
from mcts.utils import random_policy

class TicTacToe(MCTSGame):
    def __init__(self, state=None):
        if state is None:
            state = np.zeros((3, 3))
        self.state = state

    def move(self, action):
        player = int(self.state.sum()) % 2 + 1
        s = self.state.copy()
        s[action] = player
        return TicTacToe(s)

    def is_terminal(self):
        # Check horizontal, vertical, diagonal
        for i in range(3):
            if np.all(self.state[i, :] == 1) or np.all(self.state[:, i] == 1) or \
               np.all(np.diag(self.state) == 1) or np.all(np.diag(np.rot90(self.state)) == 1):
                return True
            if np.all(self.state[i, :] == 2) or np.all(self.state[:, i] == 2) or \
               np.all(np.diag(self.state) == 2) or np.all(np.diag(np.rot90(self.state)) == 2):
                return True

        # Check draw
        if np.all(self.state != 0):
            return True

        return False

    def reward(self):
        # Check horizontal, vertical, diagonal
        for i in range(3):
            if np.all(self.state[i, :] == 1) or np.all(self.state[:, i] == 1) or \
               np.all(np.diag(self.state) == 1) or np.all(np.diag(np.rot90(self.state)) == 1):
                return 1
            if np.all(self.state[i, :] == 2) or np.all(self.state[:, i] == 2) or \
               np.all(np.diag(self.state) == 2) or np.all(np.diag(np.rot90(self.state)) == 2):
                return -1

        return 0

    def actions(self):
        return [(x, y) for x in range(3) for y in range(3) if self.state[x, y] == 0]

def mcts_tictactoe_playout(state):
    game = TicTacToe(state)
    root = MCTSNode(None, 1)
    for _ in range(1000):
        node, action_history = root.select_node(game)
        node.expand_children(game.actions())
        winner, _ = random_policy(game)
        node.backup(winner, action_history)

    return root.best_action()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    s = np.array([[0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]])
    game = TicTacToe(s)
    next_move = mcts_tictactoe_playout(s)
    print(f"Best move for current Tic-Tac-Toe state, as determined by MCTS: {next_move}")
```

This code defines a simple `TicTacToe` class representing the game state and implements the necessary MCTS interface. Then, we define the `mcts_tictactoe_playout` function, where the actual MCTS algorithm is applied to find the best action for the current game state. Finally, we sample a Tic-Tac-Toe state and invoke MCTS to find the best move.
