**Data Type:**  Audio Data

## Use Cases :

a. Robotics: SARSA has been used in robot control tasks, such as obstacle avoidance or motor control, to learn the optimal policy in real-time.

b. Gaming: Building AI players that adapt to complex game dynamics, such as playing Atari games, which offer a wide range of actions, states, and rewards for different scenarios.

c. Resource Allocation: SARSA can be employed to optimize resource allocation in systems with multiple actors and uncertain outcomes, such as load balancing in computer networks or supply chain management.


## Python code: 

```python
import numpy as np

# Parameters
alpha = 0.1  # Learning rate
gamma = 0.9  # Discount rate
epsilon = 0.1  # Exploration rate
num_episodes = 500  # Number of episodes to simulate
num_states = 10  # Number of states in the environment
num_actions = 4  # Number of possible actions

# Initialize action-value function
Q = np.zeros((num_states, num_actions))

# SARSA
for episode in range(num_episodes):
    # Initialize the state
    state = np.random.randint(0, num_states)

    # Choose the action using an epsilon-greedy strategy
    if np.random.rand() < epsilon:
        action = np.random.randint(0, num_actions)
    else:
        action = np.argmax(Q[state, :])

    # Run the episode
    while True:
        # Take the action and observe the next state and reward
        next_state, reward, done = env.step(state, action)

        # Choose the next action using an epsilon-greedy strategy
        if np.random.rand() < epsilon:
            next_action = np.random.randint(0, num_actions)
        else:
            next_action = np.argmax(Q[next_state, :])

        # Update the action-value function
        Q[state, action] = Q[state, action] + alpha * (reward + gamma * Q[next_state, next_action] - Q[state, action])

        # Move to the next state-action pair
        state = next_state
        action = next_action

        if done:
            break

# Print the final action-value function
print("Final Action-Value Function:", Q)
```

Note: This is a basic and generic implementation of the SARSA algorithm, and it assumes that the environment (env) is already defined with a step() function to interact with it. You should define your specific environment, such as the Windy GridWorld or any other, before running the program.
