**Model Type:**  Natural Language Processing Models
**Data Type:**  Text Data

## Use Cases :

a. Text classification: FastText can be applied to a wide range of text classification problems, including sentiment analysis, topic classification, language detection, and spam detection.

b. Word representation learning: FastText can efficiently learn high-quality word vectors, which can be used for text similarity, analogy detection, and other natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

c. Multi-label classification: FastText can handle multi-label classification problems, where a text can have multiple labels. This has applications in areas like image captioning and multi-topic text classification.


## Python code: 

In this example, we will use FastText to perform sentiment analysis on movie reviews.

First, install the FastText library:
```
pip install fasttext
```

Prepare the training and validation data in the following format (each line contains a label and the text):
```
__label__positive I loved the movie, the acting was great!
__label__negative The movie was boring and the plot was predictable.
```

Save the files as `train.txt` and `valid.txt`.

Now, use FastText to train and evaluate the sentiment analysis model:

```python
import fasttext

# Train a FastText supervised classification model.
model = fasttext.train_supervised("train.txt")

# Save the trained model.
model.save_model("sentiment_analysis_model.bin")

# Load the trained model.
model = fasttext.load_model("sentiment_analysis_model.bin")

# Test the model on validation data.
print(model.test("valid.txt"))

# Predict the sentiment of a new movie review.
print(model.predict("I enjoyed the movie, it was an interesting story."))
```

You will get the results of the validation test along with the prediction for the new review.
