**Model Type:**  Natural Language Processing Models
**Data Type:**  Text Data

## Use Cases :

a. Natural Language Processing (NLP): TensorFlow can be used to build and train deep learning models for applications such as sentiment analysis, machine translation, and text summarization.

b. Image Recognition and Classification: TensorFlow allows the creation and training of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), enabling tasks like object recognition, facial recognition, and scene labeling in images.

c. Recommender Systems and Collaborative Filtering: TensorFlow can be used to create models for providing personalized recommendations, such as movie or product recommendations, based on past user behavior and preferences.


## Python code: 

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Flatten, ReLU
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam
from tensorflow.keras.losses import SparseCategoricalCrossentropy

# Load and preprocess the data
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()
x_train, x_test = x_train / 255.0, x_test / 255.0

# Create a model
model = Sequential([
  Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
  Dense(128, activation='relu'),
  Dense(10)
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer=Adam(),
              loss=SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

# Evaluate the model
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test, verbose=2)
print('\nTest accuracy:', test_acc)
```

In this example, a simple feedforward neural network is created using TensorFlow's Keras API to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The code demonstrates loading the data, creating a model, compiling the model, training the model, and evaluating the model on test data.
