**Model Type:**  Natural Language Processing Models
**Data Type:**  Text Data

## Use Cases :

a. Text classification: When combined with machine learning algorithms or deep learning models, like recurrent neural networks (RNN) or transformers, Word2Vec embeddings can improve the performance of text classification tasks such as sentiment analysis or spam detection.

b. Semantic similarity: Word2Vec embeddings can be used to determine the semantic similarity between words, phrases, or even entire documents by comparing the cosine similarity of their corresponding vectors.

c. Named entity recognition: By leveraging Word2Vec embeddings as input features, named entity recognition models can achieve better performance in identifying proper nouns/entities within a text.


## Python code: 

```python
import gensim.downloader as api

# Load pre-trained word2vec model
model = api.load("word2vec-google-news-300")

# Find the most similar words to 'dog'
similar_words = model.most_similar("dog")

print(similar_words)

# Find the cosine similarity between word vectors
similarity = model.similarity("cat", "dog")
print(similarity)

# Analogical reasoning using word vectors (e.g., King - Male + Female = ?)
result = model.most_similar(positive=["king", "female"], negative=["male"], topn=1)
print(result)
```

This code loads a pre-trained Word2Vec model (trained on the Google News dataset) using the Gensim library, then demonstrates finding most similar words, calculating similarity, and performing analogical reasoning.
