**Model Type:**  Natural Language Processing Models
**Data Type:**  Text Data

## Use Cases :

a. Text classification: Transformers can be applied to text classification tasks such as sentiment analysis, spam detection, and document categorization.

b. Question-answering: Models like BERT are particularly suited for extracting relevant information from text documents to answer specific questions.

c. Text generation: GPT and its successors have been used in creative applications such as story generation, code generation, and even generating conversational responses for chatbots.


## Python code: 

Here, we demonstrate a simple sentiment analysis using the Hugging Face Transformers library and BERT.

```python
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification
import torch

# Load a pre-trained BERT model for sequence classification
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

# Sample text to classify (sentiment)
text = "I love using Transformers for natural language processing tasks!"

# Encode the text
inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt")

# Get model predictions
outputs = model(**inputs)

# Calculate the probabilities using softmax
probs = torch.nn.functional.softmax(outputs.logits, dim=-1)

# Convert predictions to labels
labels = ['Negative', 'Positive']
label = labels[torch.argmax(probs).item()]

print("Sentiment analysis result:", label)
```

This code will output the sentiment analysis result for the given text.
