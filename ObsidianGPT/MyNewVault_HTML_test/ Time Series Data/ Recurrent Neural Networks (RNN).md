**Model Type:**  Exponential Smoothing State Space Models (ETS)
**Data Type:**  Time Series Data

## Use Cases :

a. Natural Language Processing (NLP): RNNs can be used for tasks like sentiment analysis, machine translation, language modeling, and speech recognition.

b. Time Series Prediction: RNNs can be used to predict future data points based on historical data, which is useful for financial forecasting, weather prediction, prediction of equipment failures, and more.

c. Sequence Generation: RNNs can be used to generate sequences, such as creating music, generating text, or even producing videos.


## Python code: 

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import SimpleRNN, Dense
import numpy as np

# Generate example data
n_samples = 100
time_steps = 10
input_dimension = 1

X = np.random.rand(n_samples, time_steps, input_dimension)
y = np.sum(X, axis=1)

# Define the RNN model
model = Sequential([
    SimpleRNN(50, input_shape=(time_steps, input_dimension), activation='relu'),
    Dense(1)
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Train the model
model.fit(X, y, epochs=100)

# Predict using the trained model
X_predict = np.random.rand(1, time_steps, input_dimension)
y_predict = model.predict(X_predict)

print("Prediction:", y_predict)
print("Actual:", np.sum(X_predict))
```

This code demonstrates the use of a simple RNN layer in Tensorflow's Keras library to approximate the sum of values in a sequence. The example data are generated randomly and then used to train the RNN model. The trained model is then used to predict the sum of values in a new sequence.
