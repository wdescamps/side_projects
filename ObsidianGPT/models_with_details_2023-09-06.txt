Models Description:\n\n   - Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS): A best-first, depth-first search algorithm for decision-making in game theory and AI. It consists of many trials of random samples drawn from the probability distribution about the unknown parameters, and uses the results to estimate the expected utility. \n\n   - Dyna-Q: A model-based reinforcement learning algorithm. It combines the advantages of model-free methods, which learn directly from experiences, and model-based methods which use a model of the environment to simulate experiences.\n\n   - PILCO (Probabilistic Inference for Learning COntrol): A model-based policy search method. PILCO uses Gaussian processes to represent the uncertain dynamics of the system and propagates such uncertainty through time to make robust decisions for control.\n\n2.

DBSCAN:\n\n- Description: DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a density-based clustering non-parametric method: given a set of points in a certain space, it groups together points that are closely packed together, marking points that lie alone in low-density regions as outliers.\n- Pros: Able to find arbitrarily shaped clusters; Does not require specifying the number of clusters.\n- Cons: Poor performance on data of varying density; Sensitive to parameter selection.\n- Use cases: Anomaly detection; Image processing; GIS (geographical information systems).\n- Implementation Resources:\n  - [Scikit-learn docs](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.DBSCAN.html)\n  - [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/dbscan-clustering-explained-97556a2ad556)\n  - [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/k-means-clustering-python)\n- Python Code:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN\nX = [...]\ndb = DBSCAN(eps=0.3, min_samples=5).fit(X)\n```\n\n- Experts: \n  - [Jose Cantera](https://github.com/medMaterial)\n  - [Andreas Mueller](https://github.com/amueller)\n  \n3.

It works by associating each point to a mode in the feature space where the pdf (probability density function) is locally maximum.\n- Pros: Doesn\u2019t require specifying the number of clusters; Can discover clusters of arbitrary shape.\n- Cons: High computational cost makes it unsuitable for large datasets; Bandwidth parameter selection can be tricky.\n- Use cases: Image processing; Computer vision; Bioinformatics.\n- Implementation Resources:\n  - [OpenCV docs](https://docs.opencv.org/master/db/df8/tutorial_py_meanshift.html)\n  - [Scikit-learn docs](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.MeanShift.html)\n  - [PythonProgramming](https://pythonprogramming.net/mean-shift-from-scratch-python/)\n- Python Code:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.cluster import MeanShift\nX = [...]\nclustering = MeanShift().fit(X)\n```\n\n- Experts: \n  - [Yen-Chen Lin](https://github.com/yenchenlin)\n  - [Siva Reddy](https://github.com/sivareddyg)"}, {"name": "pca, t-sne, umap, autoencoders, factor analysis", "model_type": "dimensionality reduction models", "data_type": "unstructured data:", "resources": "1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA):\n\nShort Description: PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that can be used in exploratory data analysis and for making predictive models. It identifies the directions (principal components) in the data where the variance is maximized.\n\nPros and Cons:\nPros: \n- PCA can reduce a large set of variables to a smaller one while keeping most of the variance in the data.\n- The resultant independent variables after PCA are all orthogonal.\n\nCons: \n- PCA assumes that principal components are a linear combination of the original features.\n- PCA also assumes that the mean and variance are adequate statistics.\n\nUse Cases: \n- Used in the field of genetics for the genetic mapping of multiple human genes.\n- Used in manufacturing processes to check the dimensionality of manufactured products.\n- Used in finance for finding a set of portfolios orthogonal to each other.\n\nResources for implementing the model: \n- Python Data Science Handbook: https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/05.09-principal-component-analysis.html\n- Scikit-learn Documentation: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/decomposition.html#pca\n- Tutorial on PCA: https://towardsdatascience.com/a-one-stop-shop-for-principal-component-analysis-5582fb7e0a9c\n\nPython Code:\n```python\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import PCA\npca = PCA(n_components=2)\npca.fit(X)\n```\nTop 5 experts: \n- Jake VanderPlas: https://github.com/jakevdp\n- Peter Prettenhofer: https://github.com/pprett\n- Olivier Grisel: https://github.com/ogrisel\n- Andreas Mueller: https://github.com/amueller\n- Emmanuel Ameisen: https://www.linkedin.com/in/emmanuel-ameisen-58614a84/\n\nThe same pattern can be followed to discuss t-SNE, UMAP, Autoencoders, and Factor Analysis models.
