# Dynamic Graph Representation Learning Model with Graph Data

## 1. Model Description

The Dynamic Graph Representation Learning model is a machine learning model used for learning representations of graph networks that evolve over time. It is specifically designed to handle dynamic graphs where the nodes and edges change over time. This model enables the representation learning of nodes and edges in a dynamic graph, capturing both their topological and temporal information.

The model utilizes techniques from graph neural networks (GNNs) and temporal modeling to learn meaningful representations. It takes into account the temporal dependencies among nodes and edges, allowing for the prediction of future graph states based on historical information.

## 2. Pros and Cons
