# DeepWalk Model for Graph Embeddings

## 1. Model Description:
The DeepWalk model is a method for learning representations of nodes in a graph through unsupervised learning. It leverages random walks, which are sequences of nodes obtained by traversing the graph. These random walks are then used to generate training samples for a Skip-gram model, which is a type of word2vec model used for learning word embeddings. DeepWalk treats the nodes in the graph as "words" and applies the Skip-gram model to predict the context (i.e., the surrounding nodes) of a given node based on its embedding representation. By optimizing this Skip-gram objective, DeepWalk learns vector representations that capture the structural and semantic properties of the graph.

## 2. Pros and Cons:
Pros:
- DeepWalk can handle large-scale graphs efficiently.
- It can capture both local and global structural information of the graph.
- The learned embeddings can be used in various downstream tasks, such as node classification, link prediction, and recommendation systems.

Cons:
- DeepWalk assumes that the graph structure is static and does not capture temporal dynamics.
- The model does not consider node attributes or edge features, focusing solely on the graph topology.
- DeepWalk may not perform as well on sparse or highly disconnected graphs.

## 3. Relevant Use Cases:
1. Node Classification: DeepWalk embeddings can be used as input features for classifying nodes in a graph, enabling applications such as fraud detection, recommendation systems, or social network analysis.
2. Link Prediction: By utilizing deep embeddings for nodes, DeepWalk can predict missing or future connections in a graph, which can be helpful in recommendation systems, social network analysis, or biological network analysis.
3. Graph Visualization: The graph embeddings obtained from DeepWalk can be used to visualize the graph structure in lower-dimensional spaces, facilitating easier interpretation and analysis of the graph.
