## 1. Model Description

The One-Class SVM (Support Vector Machine) model is a machine learning algorithm used for anomaly detection in structured data. It is designed to classify data into two categories: normal and abnormal. Unlike traditional SVM, which separates data into multiple classes, the One-Class SVM focuses solely on identifying outliers or anomalies in the data. It constructs a hyperplane that encloses normal data points, and any points outside this hyperplane are considered as anomalies.

## 2. Pros and Cons of the Model

### Pros:
- Effective for detecting outliers and anomalies in structured data.
- Can handle high-dimensional datasets well.
- Robust against overfitting.
- Does not require labeled training data, making it suitable for unsupervised learning tasks.
- Suitable for both small and large datasets.

### Cons:
- Only effective for detecting outliers and anomalies, not necessarily identifying their specific types or causes.
- Sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning.
- Requires careful selection of appropriate kernel functions.
- Limited interpretability, as the model does not provide clear explanations for detected anomalies.
- Performance can be affected by imbalanced datasets.

## 3. Relevant Use Cases

The One-Class SVM model with structured data can be used in various anomaly detection scenarios, including:

1. Cybersecurity: Detecting unusual network traffic patterns or malicious activities.
2. Fraud Detection: Identifying fraudulent transactions or anomalies in financial data.
3. Manufacturing Quality Control: Detecting defects or anomalies in production processes.
