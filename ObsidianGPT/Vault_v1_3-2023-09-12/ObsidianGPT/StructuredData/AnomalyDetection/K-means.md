# K-means model for Anomaly Detection with Structured Data

## 1. Model Description
K-means is an unsupervised machine learning model commonly used for clustering analysis. It aims to partition a dataset into K distinct clusters, where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean value. When applied to anomaly detection with structured data, K-means can identify unusual patterns or outliers in the dataset based on their distance from the cluster centroids.

## 2. Pros and Cons
Pros:
- Simple and easy to implement
- Scalable to large datasets
- Effective for identifying cluster-based anomalies

Cons:
- Assumes equal-sized and spherical clusters
- Sensitive to initial centroid initialization
- Requires predefined number of clusters (K)

## 3. Relevant Use Cases
- Fraud Detection: Identify unusual patterns in financial transactions to detect fraudulent activities.
- Network Intrusion Detection: Identify anomalous network traffic patterns to detect potential security breaches.
- Predictive Maintenance: Identify anomalies in sensor data to detect equipment or system failures before they occur.
