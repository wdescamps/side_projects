# Artificial Neural Networks Model for Structured Data Regression

## 1. Short Description
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are a type of machine learning model inspired by the biological neural networks of the human brain. ANNs are particularly effective in handling structured data for regression tasks. In this context, ANNs can learn to predict a continuous output variable based on a set of input variables.

The ANN model consists of interconnected layers of artificial neurons called nodes or units. Data flows through these neurons, where each neuron applies a transformation to the input data. The model has an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each neuron's output is determined by its activation function, which introduces non-linearity to the model.

## 2. Pros and Cons
Pros:
- Ability to learn complex relationships in data.
- Robustness to noise and missing data.
- Can handle a large number of input features.
- Less dependent on feature engineering.
- Generalization to unseen data.

Cons:
- Requires a large amount of data for training.
- Training ANNs can be computationally intensive.
- Prone to overfitting if not properly regularized.
- Difficult to interpret the learned representations.
- Black-box nature can make debugging challenging.

## 3. Relevant Use Cases
1. Stock Market Prediction: ANNs can be used to predict stock prices based on historical financial data, allowing traders and investors to make informed decisions.
2. Customer Churn Prediction: ANNs can learn patterns in customer behavior and predict the likelihood of churn, enabling businesses to take proactive measures to retain valuable customers.
3. Demand Forecasting: ANNs can be employed to forecast demand for products in various industries, helping companies optimize their inventory management and production planning.
