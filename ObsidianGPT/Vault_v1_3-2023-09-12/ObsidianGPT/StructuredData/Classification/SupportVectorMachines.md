1. **Description:** 
Support Vector Machines (SVM) is a popular classification algorithm used extensively in supervised learning tasks. It aims to find an optimal hyperplane that separates the different classes in the data. When dealing with structured data for classification tasks, SVM can leverage the features and their relationships to create decision boundaries.

2. **Pros and Cons:**
    - Pros:
        - Effective in high-dimensional spaces and with complex structures in the data.
        - Performs well when there is a clear margin of separation.
        - Versatile as it supports different kernel functions to handle both linear and non-linear relationships.
        - Handles outliers effectively by focusing on the support vectors.
    - Cons:
        - Computationally expensive for large datasets.
        - Sensitivity to noise may lead to overfitting.
        - Difficult to interpret the resulting model and extract feature importance.
        - Requires careful tuning of hyperparameters for optimal performance.

3. **Relevant Use Cases:**
    - Text classification: SVM can classify documents into different categories based on their textual content.
    - Image recognition: SVM can be used to classify objects or scenes in images based on features extracted from them.
    - Gene expression analysis: SVM can classify genes into different categories based on their expression profiles.
