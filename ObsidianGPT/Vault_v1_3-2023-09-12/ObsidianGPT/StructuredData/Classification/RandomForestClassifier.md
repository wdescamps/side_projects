# Random Forest Classifier for Classification of Structured Data

## Description
The Random Forest Classifier is a supervised machine learning model that is used for classification tasks with structured data. It is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions. Each decision tree in the random forest is trained on a random subset of the data and a random subset of the features. The predictions of all the trees are then aggregated to make the final prediction.

## Pros and Cons
Pros:
- Random Forests are robust to outliers and can handle missing values well.
- They can handle high-dimensional data and are not prone to overfitting.
- Random Forests provide an estimate of feature importance, which can be useful for understanding the underlying data.

Cons:
- Random Forests can be computationally expensive, especially for large datasets.
- They can be difficult to interpret compared to a single decision tree.
- Random Forests may not perform well on highly imbalanced datasets.

## Relevant Use Cases
1. Fraud Detection: Random Forests can be used to detect fraudulent activities in financial transactions by analyzing patterns and anomalies in the data.
2. Disease Diagnosis: Random Forests can be utilized in medical applications to classify patients as healthy or having a specific disease based on various input features like symptoms, lab results, and medical history.
3. Customer Churn Prediction: Random Forests can help identify customers who are likely to switch to a competitor by analyzing historical data on customer behavior and predicting churn probabilities.
