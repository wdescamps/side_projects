# K-Nearest Neighbors for Structured Data Classification

## 1. Model Description
The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a popular supervised machine learning model used for classification tasks on structured data. This algorithm works by examining the training dataset to find the K closest labeled instances (neighbors) to a given query point in the feature space. The predicted class for the query point is then determined by a majority vote among its K nearest neighbors.

## 2. Pros and Cons
Pros of using the KNN model for structured data classification include:
- Simplicity: KNN is easy to understand and implement.
- Non-parametric: It doesn't make assumptions about the underlying data distribution.
- Generalization: KNN can be used for both binary and multi-class classification.
- Robust to outliers: Outliers have less influence due to the majority voting approach.

Cons of the KNN model for structured data classification include:
- Computational complexity: Predicting the class of a query point can be time-consuming as it requires comparing it to all labeled instances.
- Sensitive to feature scaling: It is important to normalize or standardize features as KNN relies on computing distances.
- Curse of dimensionality: KNN performance degrades as the number of features grows, leading to the need for dimensionality reduction techniques.
- Imbalanced datasets: KNN can be biased towards the majority class in imbalanced datasets.

## 3. Relevant Use Cases
Three relevant use cases for the KNN model with structured data classification are:
- Customer Segmentation: Identifying distinct groups/clusters of customers based on their purchasing behavior, demographics, or other characteristics.
- Medical Diagnosis: Predicting diseases or conditions based on patient attributes and historical data.
- Anomaly Detection: Detecting outliers or anomalies in structured data, such as fraudulent transactions or network intrusions.
