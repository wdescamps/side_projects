# Hierarchical Clustering with Structured Data

Hierarchical Clustering is a clustering algorithm that groups similar data points into clusters based on their similarity. It creates a hierarchical structure of clusters by iteratively merging or splitting the clusters. With structured data, this algorithm can be applied to identify natural groups or patterns within the data.

## Pros and Cons
Pros:
- Does not require the number of clusters to be specified in advance.
- Provides a hierarchical structure of clusters, allowing for better understanding of the data.
- Can handle different types of distance measures and linkage methods.

Cons:
- Computationally expensive for large datasets.
- Sensitive to outliers, noise, and the order of data points.
- Difficult to determine the appropriate cut-off threshold for clustering.

## Relevant Use Cases
1. Customer Segmentation: Analyze customer data to identify distinct groups based on their behavior, preferences, or demographics.
2. Fraud Detection: Cluster financial transactions to detect anomalies or suspicious patterns indicative of fraudulent activities.
3. Image Segmentation: Cluster pixels in images with structured data to segment different objects or regions.
