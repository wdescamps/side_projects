# K-Means Clustering Model with Structured Data

## 1. Short Description
The K-Means Clustering model is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that aims to partition a given dataset into K clusters, where K is a predefined number. It is particularly suitable for structured data, where the features have a clear numerical representation.

The algorithm works by iteratively assigning each data point to the nearest centroid (cluster center) and optimizing the centroids' locations based on the mean distance of the assigned data points. This iterative process continues until the centroids converge to stable positions.

## 2. Pros and Cons

### Pros:
- Simple and easy to understand.
- Efficient and scalable for large datasets.
- Applicable to a wide range of domains and use cases.
- Robust against outliers.
- Provides interpretable cluster assignments.

### Cons:
- Requires the number of clusters (K) to be predefined.
- Sensitive to the initial placement of centroids.
- Assumes clusters are spherical and equally sized.
- Can converge to local optima.
- Not suitable for datasets with non-numerical or categorical variables.

## 3. Relevant Use Cases
K-Means Clustering with structured data can be applied to various use cases, including:
1. Market Segmentation: Identifying distinct groups of customers based on purchasing behavior, demographics, or other features to tailor marketing strategies.
2. Image Compression: Reducing the dimensionality of images by clustering similar colors or patterns to achieve compression without significant quality loss.
3. Anomaly Detection: Identifying unusual patterns or outliers in large datasets by considering data points lying far from their nearest cluster centroid.
