# Policy Gradient Methods model with Structured Data

The Policy Gradient Methods model with Structured Data is a method used in reinforcement learning to train an agent to select actions in an environment based on structured data inputs. In this model, a policy is learned that maps observations to actions, allowing the agent to make decisions in a given environment. 

## Pros and Cons
### Pros: 
- **Ability to handle structured data**: This model is well-suited for scenarios where the input data is structured, allowing the agent to utilize features and patterns in the data to make decisions.
- **Effective for continuous action spaces**: Policy Gradient Methods are often effective in scenarios with continuous action spaces, where it is challenging to find an optimal policy using discrete actions.
- **Handles stochastic policies**: This model can handle stochastic policies, allowing the agent to explore different actions and learn from the outcomes.

### Cons: 
- **High variance in gradient estimates**: Policy Gradient Methods can suffer from high variance in gradient estimates, which can lead to slow convergence and less stable learning.
- **Prone to local optima**: Like many reinforcement learning models, Policy Gradient Methods can get stuck in local optima, leading to sub-optimal policies.
- **Sensitive to hyperparameter choices**: The performance of the model can be greatly affected by the choice of hyperparameters, making it important to carefully tune them for optimal results.

## Relevant Use Cases
1. **Robotic Manipulation**: Policy Gradient Methods with Structured Data can be used to train robots to perform complex manipulation tasks, leveraging the structured sensory data from the robot's sensors to make decisions.
2. **Autonomous Driving**: This model can also be used in autonomous driving scenarios, where the agent needs to process structured data from various sensors to navigate and perform driving maneuvers.
3. **Financial Trading**: Policy Gradient Methods can be applied in financial trading, utilizing structured data such as historical prices and indicators to make buy/sell decisions and optimize trading strategies.
