# Autoencoders for Time Series Data Anomaly Detection

**1. Short description of the model:**
Autoencoders are deep neural network models that are used for unsupervised learning tasks. They are widely used for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction. In the context of time series data, Autoencoders can be used for anomaly detection. The basic idea is to train an Autoencoder on normal data and then use it to reconstruct new data. If the reconstruction error is above a certain threshold, the data point is considered an anomaly.

**2. Pros and Cons of the model:**
Pros:
- Can capture complex patterns in time series data.
- Unsupervised learning, so it doesn't require labeled data for training.
- Can handle high-dimensional data.
- Can learn lower-dimensional representations of the input data, aiding in visualization and interpretation.

Cons:
- Model training can be computationally expensive.
- Sensitivity to noise in data.
- May not work well when anomalies have low frequency or novel patterns.

**3. Relevant use cases:**
- Fraud detection in financial transactions: Autoencoders can be used to detect anomalies in transaction patterns that may indicate fraudulent activities.
- IoT sensor data monitoring: Autoencoders can detect anomalies in sensor data collected from IoT devices, helping to identify malfunctioning or faulty devices.
- Network intrusion detection: Autoencoders can be used to detect unusual network traffic patterns that may indicate a cybersecurity breach.
