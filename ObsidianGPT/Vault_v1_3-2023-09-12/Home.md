Hi  ! 

**Idea of this project**  :
I'm was lost in the variety of algorithms available in ML/Deep Learning. 

- Which are the best for which types of data? 
- What are their pros and cons?
- Who's knowledgeable on this topic? What's their Github?

**This site is a solution to this problem** 
--> Please see the **Graph View** on your right.

**Important** : This Vault was created programmatically using Python and ChatGPT API. See the code [here](https://github.com/wdescamps/ObsidianGPT)
