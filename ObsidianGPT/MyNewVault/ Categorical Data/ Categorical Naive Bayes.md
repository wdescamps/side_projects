**Model Type:**  Classification Models
**Data Type:**  Categorical Data

## Use Cases :

a. Text classification: Categorical Naive Bayes is widely used for natural language processing tasks like email spam filtering, sentiment analysis, and document classification.

b. Medical diagnosis: The algorithm is useful in medical fields to help categorize a patient's diagnostic information and predict the possible disease.

c. Product recommendations: It can be used to build recommender systems that predict product categories users may be interested in based on their past behaviors and interests.


## Python code: 

```python
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.naive_bayes import CategoricalNB
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load the 20 newsgroups dataset
newsgroups = fetch_20newsgroups(subset='all', remove=('headers', 'footers', 'quotes'))
X, y = newsgroups.data, newsgroups.target

# Vectorize the text data
vectorizer = CountVectorizer(stop_words='english', max_features=1000, binary=True)
X_vectorized = vectorizer.fit_transform(X).toarray()

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_vectorized, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a Categorical Naive Bayes model
clf = CategoricalNB()
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions and calculate accuracy
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print('Accuracy:', accuracy)
```

This sample code demonstrates the use of Categorical Naive Bayes for text classification with the 20 newsgroups dataset. It vectorizes the text data, splits it into training and testing sets, trains a Categorical Naive Bayes model, and calculates the accuracy of the model.
