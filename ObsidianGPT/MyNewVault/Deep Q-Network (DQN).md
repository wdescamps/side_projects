**Data Type**: Reinforcement Learning

**Description**:

The Deep Q-Network (DQN) model is a type of Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm used for training agents to take actions in an environment. It is a neural network that applies Q-Learning, an RL algorithm that learns the optimal action-value function, to high-dimensional state and action spaces. The DQN model uses a deep neural network to approximate the Q-function, which maps states and actions to their estimated values.

The best use case for DQN is in training agents in complex environments where state and action spaces are high-dimensional. For example, this model has been successfully used in Atari video games where a robotic agent learns how to efficiently play games such as Pong, Space Invaders, and Breakout. The DQN model can also be used for autonomous driving, robotics, game playing and recommendation systems.

DQNs are a powerful technique for modeling and solving sequential decision-making problems using neural networks. Its ability to handle high-dimensional state and action spaces enables it to excel in various complex environments, making it one of the most commonly used RL methods in recent years.
