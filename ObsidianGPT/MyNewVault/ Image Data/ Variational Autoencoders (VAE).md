**Model Type:**  Image Generation Models
**Data Type:**  Image Data

## Use Cases :

a) Image generation and synthesis: VAEs can be used to generate realistic new images similar to a given dataset. This has applications in the field of computer vision, such as data augmentation, image inpainting, and style transfer.

b) Anomaly detection: VAEs can be used to model the distribution of normal data points and therefore identify outliers or anomalies by measuring how likely a given data point is under the learned distribution.

c) Dimensionality reduction and feature extraction: VAEs can be utilized to learn a compact and meaningful low-dimensional representation of high-dimensional input data, which can then be used for tasks like visualization or downstream classification and regression tasks.


## Python code: 

Here's an example using the Keras library for the implementation of a simple Variational Autoencoder:

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Dense, Lambda
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras import backend as K

# Load MNIST dataset
(x_train, _), (x_test, _) = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
x_train = x_train.astype('float32') / 255.
x_test = x_test.astype('float32') / 255.
x_train = x_train.reshape((len(x_train), np.prod(x_train.shape[1:])))
x_test = x_test.reshape((len(x_test), np.prod(x_test.shape[1:])))

# Model parameters
input_dim = x_train.shape[1]
latent_dim = 2
intermediate_dim = 256
batch_size = 100
epochs = 50
epsilon_std = 1.0

def sampling(args):
    z_mean, z_log_var = args
    epsilon = K.random_normal(shape=(batch_size, latent_dim), mean=0., stddev=epsilon_std)
    return z_mean + K.exp(z_log_var / 2) * epsilon

# Encoder network
x = Input(shape=(input_dim,))
h = Dense(intermediate_dim, activation='relu')(x)
z_mean = Dense(latent_dim)(h)
z_log_var = Dense(latent_dim)(h)
z = Lambda(sampling)([z_mean, z_log_var])

encoder = Model(x, z_mean)

# Decoder network
decoder_h = Dense(intermediate_dim, activation='relu')
decoder_mean = Dense(input_dim, activation='sigmoid')
h_decoded = decoder_h(z)
x_decoded_mean = decoder_mean(h_decoded)

# VAE model
vae = Model(x, x_decoded_mean)

# VAE loss
def vae_loss(x, x_decoded_mean):
    xent_loss = tf.keras.losses.binary_crossentropy(x, x_decoded_mean)
    kl_loss = - 0.5 * K.mean(1 + z_log_var - K.square(z_mean) - K.exp(z_log_var), axis=-1)
    return xent_loss + kl_loss

vae.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=vae_loss)

# Train VAE
vae.fit(x_train, x_train, shuffle=True, epochs=epochs, batch_size=batch_size, validation_data=(x_test, x_test))
```

In this example, a simple VAE is trained on the MNIST dataset for digit generation. The encoder and decoder networks are both implemented as single-layer neural networks. The VAE loss function combines the reconstruction loss (binary cross-entropy) and the KL-divergence to enforce the Gaussian prior on the latent space.
