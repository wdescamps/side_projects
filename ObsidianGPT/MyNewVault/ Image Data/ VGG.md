#  VGG
**Model Type:**  Computer Vision Models
**Data Type:**  Image Data

**Python code **:


```python
import numpy as np
from keras.applications.vgg16 import VGG16, preprocess_input, decode_predictions
from keras.preprocessing import image

# Load the pre-trained VGG model
model = VGG16(weights='imagenet')

# Load and preprocess the image
img_path = 'path/to/your/image.jpg'
img = image.load_img(img_path, target_size=(224, 224))
x = image.img_to_array(img)
x = np.expand_dims(x, axis=0)
x = preprocess_input(x)

# Make a prediction using the model
preds = model.predict(x)

# Decode the prediction and print the top 3 results
print('Top 3 predictions:', decode_predictions(preds, top=3)[0])
```

This code demonstrates how to use the pre-trained VGG16 model in Keras to make predictions on a given input image. The model is loaded with ImageNet weights, and the input image is preprocessed according to VGG requirements. The predictions are then decoded, and the top 3 predicted classes are printed.
