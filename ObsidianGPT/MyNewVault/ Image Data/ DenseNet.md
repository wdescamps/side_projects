**Model Type:**  Computer Vision Models
**Data Type:**  Image Data

## Use Cases :

a) Image Classification: DenseNet has been highly successful in image classification tasks, providing state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet.

b) Object Detection: DenseNet can be used as the backbone network for object detection tasks, where it performs feature extraction, which can then be combined with other frameworks, such as Faster R-CNN, for detecting objects within images.

c) Semantic Segmentation: DenseNet can also be used for semantic segmentation tasks, where it is necessary to assign a class label to each pixel in an image. By combining DenseNet with other architectures such as U-Net, dense connectivity can enhance the model's feature extraction ability and improve segmentation results.


## Python code: 

```python
import keras
from keras.layers import Dense, GlobalAveragePooling2D
from keras.models import Model
from keras.applications.densenet import DenseNet121, preprocess_input
from keras.optimizers import Adam
from keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

# Load & preprocess data
train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(preprocessing_function=preprocess_input)
test_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(preprocessing_function=preprocess_input)

train_generator = train_datagen.flow_from_directory('data/train', target_size=(224, 224), batch_size=32, class_mode='categorical')
test_generator = test_datagen.flow_from_directory('data/test', target_size=(224, 224), batch_size=32, class_mode='categorical')

# Build the DenseNet121 model
base_model = DenseNet121(weights='imagenet', include_top=False)

# Add a global average pooling layer and a fully connected layer for classification
x = base_model.output
x = GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)
predictions = Dense(train_generator.num_classes, activation='softmax')(x)

# Create the final model
model = Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=predictions)

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer=Adam(lr=0.0001), loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit_generator(
    train_generator,
    steps_per_epoch=train_generator.samples // train_generator.batch_size,
    validation_data=test_generator,
    validation_steps=test_generator.samples // test_generator.batch_size,
    epochs=10)
```

This code demonstrates the use of DenseNet for an image classification task. The script imports necessary libraries, loads and pre-processes the data, builds the model, and trains the model using the provided data.
