#  Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
**Model Type:**  Dimensionality Reduction Models
**Data Type:**  Unstructured Data

**Python code **:


```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.discriminant_analysis import LinearDiscriminantAnalysis
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load the Iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
X, y = iris.data, iris.target

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create the LDA model
lda = LinearDiscriminantAnalysis()

# Fit the model to the training data
lda.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Perform predictions using the testing set
y_pred = lda.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model's accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

print("Linear Discriminant Analysis model's accuracy: {:.2f}%".format(accuracy * 100))
```
This code demonstrates how to use the Linear Discriminant Analysis model for classification using the Iris dataset. We first import the necessary packages and load the dataset. Then, we split the data into training and testing sets, create and fit the LDA model, and finally evaluate its accuracy.
