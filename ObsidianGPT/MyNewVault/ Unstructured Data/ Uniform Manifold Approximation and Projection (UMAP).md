**Model Type:**  Dimensionality Reduction Models
**Data Type:**  Unstructured Data

## Use Cases :

a. Data Visualization: UMAP can be used to visualize complex, high-dimensional data, making it easier to detect patterns, clusters, and structures within the data.

b. Preprocessing for Machine Learning: UMAP can be used as a preprocessing step to reduce the dimensionality of data before feeding it into a machine learning model, potentially improving model performance and reducing training time.

c. Feature Extraction: UMAP can be used to discover meaningful low-dimensional representations of high-dimensional data, which can be treated as new features and used in various data analysis tasks.


## Python code: 

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.datasets import load_digits
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import umap

# Load the sample dataset - Digits dataset from scikit-learn
data, labels = load_digits(return_X_y=True)

# Instantiate UMAP model
model = umap.UMAP(n_neighbors=15, min_dist=0.1, n_components=2, random_state=42)

# Fit the model and transform the data
reduced_data = model.fit_transform(data)

# Plot the reduced data
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
plt.scatter(reduced_data[:, 0], reduced_data[:, 1], c=labels, cmap='Spectral', s=5)
plt.colorbar(boundaries=np.arange(11)-0.5).set_ticks(np.arange(10))
plt.title('UMAP projection of Digits dataset', fontsize=16)
plt.show()
```

This code demonstrates how to use UMAP to perform dimensionality reduction on the Digits dataset from scikit-learn, and then visualizes the resulting low-dimensional representation using a scatter plot.
