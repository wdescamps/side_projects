**Model Type:**  Clustering Models
**Data Type:**  Unstructured Data

## Use Cases :

a. Spatial data analysis: DBSCAN is highly effective in identifying clusters of spatial data, such as geographic information systems (GIS) data or location-based data.

b. Anomaly detection: DBSCAN can be employed to detect and remove outliers, or unusual data points, from datasets due to its noise handling capabilities.

c. Image segmentation: In computer vision, DBSCAN has been used for image segmentation, separating regions in an image based on their density of pixels.


## Python code: 

```python
# Importing necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs
from sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN

# Generating random sample dataset
data, labels = make_blobs(n_samples=300, centers=4, random_state=42)

# Displaying the generated dataset
plt.scatter(data[:, 0], data[:, 1], c=labels, cmap='viridis')
plt.title("Generated Dataset")
plt.show()

# Applying DBSCAN model
dbscan = DBSCAN(eps=1, min_samples=5)
dbscan.fit(data)

# Visualizing the results
plt.scatter(data[:, 0], data[:, 1], c=dbscan.labels_, cmap='viridis')
plt.title("DBSCAN Clustering")
plt.show()
```

This code creates a dataset with four clusters and then applies the DBSCAN algorithm to identify these clusters. The original dataset and the clustering result are visualized using Matplotlib.
