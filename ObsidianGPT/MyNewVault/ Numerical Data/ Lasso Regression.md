**Model Type:**  Regression Models
**Data Type:**  Numerical Data

## Use Cases :

a. Feature Selection: Lasso Regression can be used in scenarios where there are a large number of features, and it helps in identifying and retaining only the important features.

b. Model Interpretability: It creates simpler, more interpretable models by removing or reducing the impact of irrelevant features, making it easier to understand the relationship between the features and the target variable.

c. Avoiding Overfitting: Regularization in Lasso Regression can help in avoiding overfitting by shrinking the coefficients of less important features, thus preventing the model from fitting too closely to the training data.


## Python code: 

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import Lasso
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Creating a sample dataset
data = {
    "x1": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    "x2": [2, 4, 6, 8, 10],
    "y": [2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Defining the features and target variable
X = df[["x1", "x2"]]
y = df["y"]

# Splitting the dataset into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=42)

# Applying Lasso Regression
lasso = Lasso(alpha=0.1)
lasso.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Making predictions
y_pred = lasso.predict(X_test)

# Evaluating the model
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")
```

In this example, the Lasso Regression model is applied to a simple dataset with two features and evaluated using the mean squared error metric.
