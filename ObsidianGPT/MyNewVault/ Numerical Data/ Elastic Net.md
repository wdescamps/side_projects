**Model Type:**  Regression Models
**Data Type:**  Numerical Data

## Use Cases :

a. High-dimensional data: Elastic Net can be used effectively in high-dimensional datasets, where the number of features is much higher than the number of data points.

b. Feature selection: It is useful for feature selection, as it is capable of effectively ignoring irrelevant features and focusing on the more important ones.

c. Multi-collinearity: Elastic Net is also helpful in managing multi-collinearity, i.e., when there are multiple correlated features in the dataset, it is able to maintain model stability and prevent overfitting.


## Python code: 

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import ElasticNet
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.datasets import make_regression

# Create a synthetic dataset
X, y = make_regression(n_features=100, noise=0.5, n_samples=1000)

# Split the data into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Apply the Elastic Net model
enet = ElasticNet(alpha = 1, l1_ratio = 0.5)  # alpha controls the amount of regularization, l1_ratio controls the balance between Lasso (l1_ratio=1) and Ridge (l1_ratio=0).

# Fit the model to the training data
enet.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = enet.predict(X_test)

# Calculate the R^2 score
r2_score = enet.score(X_test, y_test)

print("R^2 Score:", r2_score)

# Visualize the coefficients of the Elastic Net model
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.plot(enet.coef_)
plt.xlabel("Feature Index")
plt.ylabel("Coefficient Value")
plt.title("Elastic Net Coefficients")
plt.show()
```

This code snippet demonstrates the use of Elastic Net by generating a synthetic dataset, splitting it into training and testing data, applying the Elastic Net model, and visualizing the coefficients.
