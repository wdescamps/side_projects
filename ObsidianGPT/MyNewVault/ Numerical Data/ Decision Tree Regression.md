**Model Type:**  Regression Models
**Data Type:**  Numerical Data

## Use Cases :

a. Predicting housing prices based on features like area, number of rooms, location, and age of the property.

b. Forecasting sales and demand for products based on aspects like seasonality, promotions, and competition.

c. Estimating energy consumption in a building based on factors like outdoor temperature, number of occupants, and time of day.


## Python code: 

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Load the data
data = pd.read_csv('housing_data.csv')
X = data.drop('price', axis=1)
y = data['price']

# Split the data into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Create and train the model
tree_regressor = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=4, random_state=42)
tree_regressor.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on test set
y_pred = tree_regressor.predict(X_test)

# Calculate error metric (Mean Squared Error)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print("Mean Squared Error:", mse)
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to use the DecisionTreeRegressor class from the scikit-learn library to predict housing prices from a dataset. The data is loaded, split into train and test sets, and then used to train and evaluate the model. The resulting mean squared error is printed to evaluate the model's performance.
