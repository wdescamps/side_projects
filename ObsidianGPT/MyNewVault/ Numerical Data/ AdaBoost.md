**Model Type:**  Classification Models
**Data Type:**  Numerical Data

## Use Cases :

a. Object Detection: AdaBoost is commonly used in computer vision tasks, like detecting objects, faces, or pedestrians within images.

b. Text Classification: AdaBoost can be applied in tasks like sentiment analysis or spam email detection, where the goal is to classify text into pre-defined categories.

c. Speech Recognition: It can also be used in speech processing tasks, such as speaker identification or emotion classification from speech data.


## Python code: 

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv('https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data', header=None)
data.columns = ['sepal_length', 'sepal_width', 'petal_length', 'petal_width', 'class']

# Preprocess the dataset
X = data.drop('class', axis=1)
y = data['class']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Train AdaBoost Classifier
adaboost = AdaBoostClassifier(n_estimators=50, learning_rate=1.0, random_state=42)
adaboost.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions and evaluate model performance
y_pred = adaboost.predict(X_test)
print("Accuracy Score:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print("Classification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

This code demonstrates how to use the AdaBoost Classifier from scikit-learn library to classify the Iris dataset. It evaluates the model's performance on a test set using the accuracy score and classification report.
