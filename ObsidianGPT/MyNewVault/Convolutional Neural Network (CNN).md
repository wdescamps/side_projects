**Data Type**: Image Data

**Description**:

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a deep learning architecture that is designed for processing images and other multi-dimensional data such as videos or sounds. Unlike traditional neural networks which were originally designed for processing flat data, CNNs are capable of recognizing spatial patterns and identifying features in an image.

The best use case for CNNs is in image classification and object recognition tasks. CNNs are built on the concept of convolution, which is the process of filtering an image or input with a set of learnable weights referred to as kernels or filters. This process helps to extract important features in the image data and reduce the complexity of the input by shrinking the dimensionality of the image. The output of the convolution operation is then passed through an activation function and pooled into subsamples, creating a feature map.

Convolutional layers are stacked to build a deep neural network capable of recognizing complex patterns. These layers are often followed by fully connected layers, which use the feature maps extracted by the convolutional layers as input. The fully connected layers use these feature maps for classification.

CNNs are highly effective for image classification tasks as they can automatically learn and extract features from the input data. They minimize the need for feature engineering to manually extract features from the image data, as CNNs can learn to distinguish the different types of features present in an image. This makes them effective for a wide variety of image processing tasks including object detection, image segmentation, and image recognition.
