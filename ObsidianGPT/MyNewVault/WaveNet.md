**Data Type**: Audio Data

**Description**:

WaveNet is a deep neural network model that is used for generating realistic-sounding speech or audio. It was designed in 2016 by researchers at Google DeepMind and is based on autoregressive generative modeling, where the output of the model is conditioned on the preceding output. 

WaveNet has become popular in the field of natural language processing and speech synthesis due to its ability to produce high-quality, realistic audio. It is a variant of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that uses dilated convolutions to increase the receptive field of the network while reducing the number of parameters. 

The best use case for WaveNet is in generating speech or audio for virtual assistants or customer support chatbots. WaveNet can create natural-sounding voices, which can make the interaction with the chatbot more pleasant and life-like. It can even mimic the voice of a particular person to continue conversations as per a typical chatbot use-case. The WaveNet model is also used in text-to-speech programs, where it can generate expressive voices with different tones and emotions.
