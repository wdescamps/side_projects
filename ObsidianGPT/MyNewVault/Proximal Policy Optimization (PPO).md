**Data Type**: Reinforcement Learning

**Description**:

Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is a type of reinforcement learning algorithm that is designed for environments with continuous action spaces. Unlike traditional reinforcement learning algorithms that directly optimize the policy function, PPO uses a surrogate objective function that ensures that small changes to the policy do not result in large changes to the policy's performance.

PPO is designed to strike a balance between exploration and exploitation of the environment. It explores new actions by sampling from the policy distribution and exploits the environment by using the policy with the highest expected return. PPO consists of two phases: data collection and optimization. In the data collection phase, the agent interacts with the environment to collect a batch of data. In the optimization phase, the agent uses the collected data to update its policy in a way that maximizes its expected return in future interactions with the environment.

The best use case for PPO in reinforcement learning is in environments with continuous action spaces, such as robotics or game playing. PPO has been shown to perform well in complex environments with noisy, high-dimensional input spaces. Additionally, PPO is known for being robust to hyperparameter choices and relatively easy to tune compared to other reinforcement learning algorithms.
