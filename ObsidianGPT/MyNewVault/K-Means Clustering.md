**Data Type**: Unstructured Data

**Description**:

The K-Means Clustering model is a machine learning algorithm used for classification and grouping of centroid-based data. This algorithm uses unsupervised learning techniques to find patterns and relationships in unlabeled data. The K-means algorithm takes in as input a dataset and a value for "K," which represents the number of clusters desired. The algorithm then tries to find the K number of centroids that can best represent the data points.

The best use case of the K-means clustering model for unstructured data is in analyzing customer data, such as social media comments, product reviews, and surveys. Through the clustering model, businesses can segment their customers into groups with similar opinions, preferences, and behaviors. These groups can then be used to understand customer behavior, predict customer needs, and tailor marketing strategies to specific customer segments. Additionally, K-means clustering can also be used for image segmentation, anomaly detection, and document clustering in unstructured data.
