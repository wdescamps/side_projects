**Data Type**: Categorical Data

**Description**:

Gradient Boosting is an ensemble learning technique used for both classification and regression problems. It builds an ensemble of weak decision tree models sequentially, allowing the model to learn from the mistakes of previous models.

For categorical data, Gradient Boosting can be used effectively for feature selection and variable interactions. It is particularly useful for datasets with a large number of categorical features as it handles them well and avoids overfitting. Gradient Boosting can be used for both binary and multi-class classification problems.

The best use case for Gradient Boosting with categorical data is in data analysis and classification tasks such as customer churn prediction, fraud detection or text classification. It can handle high-dimensional and complex datasets, and can also be used with imbalanced datasets. It is particularly useful when there are interactions between variables and the goal is to achieve high accuracy.
