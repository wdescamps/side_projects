**Model Type:**  Exponential Smoothing State Space Models (ETS)
**Data Type:**  Time Series Data

## Use Cases :

a. Language modeling and text generation: GRUs can be used to predict the next word in a sentence, given a sequence of words, and be utilized in tasks such as text generation, summarization, or machine translation.

b. Time series prediction: GRU models can be employed to forecast future values in time series data, such as stock prices, weather patterns, or energy consumption.

c. Speech recognition and synthesis: GRUs can be applied to model the sequence of acoustic signals in speech data, enabling applications like automatic speech recognition, speaker identification, and speech synthesis.


## Python code: 

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, GRU, Embedding
from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical

# Generate synthetic time series data
def generate_data(num_sequences, sequence_len):
    X = np.random.rand(num_sequences, sequence_len)
    y = X.sum(axis=1) > sequence_len / 2
    return X[..., np.newaxis], to_categorical(y)


# Define GRU model
def build_model(sequence_len):
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(GRU(32, input_shape=(sequence_len, 1)))
    model.add(Dense(2, activation="softmax"))

    model.compile(optimizer="adam", loss="categorical_crossentropy", metrics=["accuracy"])
    return model


# Generate and preprocess data
num_sequences = 1000
sequence_len = 20
X, y = generate_data(num_sequences, sequence_len)

# Split the data into training and testing sets
train_X, test_X = X[: int(0.8 * num_sequences)], X[int(0.8 * num_sequences) :]
train_y, test_y = y[: int(0.8 * num_sequences)], y[int(0.8 * num_sequences) :]

# Build and train the GRU model
model = build_model(sequence_len)
model.fit(train_X, train_y, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

# Evaluate the GRU model
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(test_X, test_y)
print(f"Test accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")
```

This code demonstrates how to use a GRU model to classify whether the sum of the elements in a synthetic time series is greater than half the sequence length. The code builds and trains a GRU model using TensorFlow Keras, and prints the test accuracy of the model.
