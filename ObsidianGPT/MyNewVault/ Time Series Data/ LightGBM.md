**Model Type:**  Exponential Smoothing State Space Models (ETS)
**Data Type:**  Time Series Data

## Use Cases :

a. Binary and Multiclass Classification: LightGBM is suitable for binary and multiclass classification problems where high accuracy is required and datasets may be large.

b. Regression: LightGBM can be used to handle regression tasks, enabling the prediction of continuous numerical output by minimizing the loss function.

c. Ranking: LightGBM can be adapted to tackle ranking problems by incorporating query and relevance data, optimizing it for applications such as search engine result rankings or recommendation systems.


## Python code: 

```python
import numpy as np
import lightgbm as lgb
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load the Iris dataset
data = load_iris()
X = data.data
y = data.target

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Convert data into LightGBM Dataset format
train_data = lgb.Dataset(X_train, label=y_train)
test_data = lgb.Dataset(X_test, label=y_test, reference=train_data)

# Define the parameters of the LightGBM model
params = {
    'boosting_type': 'gbdt',
    'objective': 'multiclass',
    'num_class': 3,
    'metric': 'multi_logloss',
    'feature_fraction': 0.8,
    'bagging_fraction': 0.8,
    'bagging_freq': 5,
    'learning_rate': 0.1,
    'num_iterations': 100,
    'verbose': -1
}

# Train the LightGBM model
model = lgb.train(params, train_data, valid_sets=test_data, early_stopping_rounds=10)

# Make predictions using the trained model
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
y_pred = np.argmax(y_pred, axis=1) # Get the index (class) with the highest probability

# Evaluate the model performance
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print('Accuracy:', accuracy)
```

This example demonstrates the use of LightGBM for a multiclass classification task on the Iris dataset. It imports the necessary libraries, loads the data, and splits it into training and testing sets. The data is then converted into the LightGBM Dataset format, and parameters for the model are defined. After training, the model is applied to make predictions on the test set, and its accuracy is evaluated.
