**Model Type:**  Music Generation Models
**Data Type:**  Audio Data

## Use Cases :

a. Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems: WaveNet can be used to improve speech synthesis by generating natural, human-like voices, as demonstrated in Google Assistant and Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API.

b. Music generation: WaveNet can generate high-quality music samples by learning from a given dataset of instrumental music.

c. Audio denoising and compression: WaveNet's capability to generate coherent audio signals can be leveraged for denoising and compression tasks in audio processing and synthesis.


## Python code: 

```python
# Note that this code assumes you have installed the tensorflow-wavenet implementation
# (https://github.com/ibab/tensorflow-wavenet) and has generated a checkpoint file from a trained model.

import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow_wavenet import WaveNetModel


def generate_audio_from_condition(input_data, checkpoint_path, output_path):
    # Create the WaveNet model
    model = WaveNetModel(batch_size=1,
                         dilations=[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1],
                         filter_width=2,
                         residual_channels=32,
                         dilation_channels=32,
                         skip_channels=128,
                         quantization_channels=256)

    # Generate audio samples
    with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
        sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())
        saver = tf.compat.v1.train.Saver()
        saver.restore(sess, checkpoint_path)

        generated_audio = sess.run(model.sample_op, feed_dict={model.input_ph: input_data})

    # Save the generated audio
    np.save(output_path, generated_audio)


# Example usage
condition_data = np.load("example_condition_data.npy")  # Load your condition data
checkpoint_file = "path/to/checkpoint"  # Checkpoint file from trained model
output_file = "generated_audio.npy"  # Output file for generated audio

generate_audio_from_condition(condition_data, checkpoint_file, output_file)
```

Keep in mind that WaveNet can be computationally heavy, and the sample code above might require adjustments depending on your specific use case and data.
