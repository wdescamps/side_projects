#  Transformer models
**Model Type:**  Music Generation Models
**Data Type:**  Audio Data

**Python code **:

Here's a simple example using the Hugging Face `transformers` library to perform sentiment analysis with a pre-trained BERT model.

```python
!pip install transformers

from transformers import pipeline

# Initialize sentiment analysis pipeline with BERT model.
nlp = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")

# Provide input texts.
input_texts = ["I love this product!", "This is a terrible experience."]

# Perform sentiment analysis on the input texts.
results = nlp(input_texts)

# Print results.
for i, result in enumerate(results):
    print(f"Text: {input_texts[i]}")
    print(f"Sentiment: {result['label']}, Score: {result['score']}\n")
```

This code installs the `transformers` library, initializes a sentiment analysis pipeline with a pre-trained BERT model, and performs sentiment analysis on a list of input texts, outputting the sentiment and score for each text.
