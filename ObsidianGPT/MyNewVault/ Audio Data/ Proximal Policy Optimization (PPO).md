#  Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
**Model Type:**  Music Generation Models
**Data Type:**  Audio Data

**Python code **:


Here's a simple Python code demonstrating the use of PPO to train an agent in the "CartPole-v1" environment using Stable Baselines.

```python
import gym
from stable_baselines import PPO2
from stable_baselines.common.policies import MlpPolicy

def main():
    # Create the CartPole environment
    env = gym.make("CartPole-v1")

    # Instantiate the PPO model
    model = PPO2(MlpPolicy, env, verbose=1)

    # Train the PPO model
    model.learn(total_timesteps=100000)

    # Evaluate the trained model
    for episode in range(10):
        obs = env.reset()
        done = False
        while not done:
            action, _states = model.predict(obs, deterministic=True)
            obs, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
            env.render()

    env.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
Before running the code, please install the required packages using the following command:
```
pip install gym stable-baselines[mpi]
```
