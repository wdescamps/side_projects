**Model Type:**  Music Generation Models
**Data Type:**  Audio Data

## Use Cases :

a. Music Composition: MidiNet can be used by musicians and composers to generate new ideas or create entire musical pieces based on their MIDI inputs.

b. Automatic Music Generation: MidiNet can be used in applications that require automatic generation of background music, such as video games, movies, and other multimedia content.

c. Music Education: People learning composition or music theory can use MidiNet to study generated music, examining the patterns and structures in the output and enhancing their understanding of musical concepts.


## Python code: 

To demonstrate the MidiNet model, we'll use MuseGAN library. Make sure to install the required packages:

```
pip install musegan
pip install tensorflow-gpu
pip install pypianoroll
```

Below is a Python code snippet that uses the pretrained MidiNet model from MuseGAN to generate new music:

```python
import numpy as np
import os
from pypianoroll import Multitrack, Track
from musegan.bmusegan.components import MuseGAN
from config import CHECKPOINT_DIR, SAMPLES_DIR, CONFIGS

# Specify the model checkpoint and set up the model
checkpoint_dir = os.path.join(CHECKPOINT_DIR, 'musegan/exp_midi')
config_module = CONFIGS['musegan']

# Initialize and build the MuseGAN model
model = MuseGAN()
model.build(config_module)
model.load(checkpoint_dir)

# Generate a random noise and use the model to generate new music
z = np.random.rand(1, config_module.NOISE_DIM) * 2 - 1
generated_data = model.generate(z)[0]

# Convert the generated data to a MIDI multitrack file
tracks = []
for idx, track in enumerate(config_module.TRACK_NAMES):
    pianoroll = np.pad(
        generated_data[idx] > config_module.BINARY_THRESHOLD,
        ((0, 0), (config_module.FIRST_BAR, 0)),
        'constant'
    )
    tracks.append(Track(pianoroll=pianoroll, program=0, is_drum=(idx == 1),
            name=track))

multitrack = Multitrack(tracks=tracks, tempo=config_module.TEMPO,
        beat_resolution=config_module.BEAT_RESOLUTION)
multitrack.write(os.path.join(SAMPLES_DIR, 'generated.mid'))
```

The output will be a new MIDI file called "generated.mid" that contains the generated music. Note that you'll need to update the `CHECKPOINT_DIR`, `SAMPLES_DIR`, and `CONFIGS` variables to point to the appropriate directories and files for the MuseGAN model.
