#  Actor
**Model Type:**  Music Generation Models
**Data Type:**  Audio Data

**Python code **:


```python
import pykka

# Define an actor by extending the `pykka.ThreadingActor` class
class GreeterActor(pykka.ThreadingActor):
    def on_receive(self, message):
        return f"Hello, {message['name']}!"

# Create an instance of the actor
greeter = GreeterActor.start().proxy()

# Send a message containing a dictionary with a 'name' key to the actor
response = greeter.ask({"name": "John Doe"})

# Print the response
print(response.get())  # Output: "Hello, John Doe!"

# Stop the actor
greeter.stop()
```

This example demonstrates a simple actor-based program using the Pykka library. The GreeterActor class is defined by extending the `pykka.ThreadingActor` class, and implementing the `on_receive` method. The actor system is used to start the actor, and a message is sent to the actor using the `ask` method. The response from the actor is then printed and the actor is stopped.
