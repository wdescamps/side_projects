**Model Type:**  Music Generation Models
**Data Type:**  Audio Data

## Use Cases :

a. Robotics: PILCO can be used for teaching robots to execute complex manipulation tasks, such as grasping, pushing, and lifting objects while accommodating for environmental uncertainties

b. Autonomous Vehicles: PILCO can be applied in learning optimal control policies for self-driving cars, enabling them to adapt to different traffic scenarios while considering the uncertainty in the predictions

c. Game Playing: PILCO can be used for training agents to learn optimal strategies in continuous-space video games, e.g., racing, flying, or navigation tasks with uncertain dynamics


## Python code: 

Before running the code, you will need to install the GPflow and GPflowPILCO libraries:

```bash
pip install gpflow
pip install git+https://github.com/nrontsis/PILCO
```

Then you can use the following code to demonstrate PILCO:

```python
import numpy as np
from pilco.models import PILCO
from pilco.controllers import RbfController, LinearController
from pilco.rewards import ExponentialReward
from pilco.simulation import rollout
from pilco.datasets import planar_arm_initial_state_dist, planar_arm_environment
from pilco.predefined_costs import planar_arm_cost

# Set random seed for reproducibility
np.random.seed(0)

# Load the environment
env, target = planar_arm_environment()

# Define the initial state distribution
state_dim = env.observation_space.shape[0]
action_dim = env.action_space.shape[0]
initial_state_dist = planar_arm_initial_state_dist()

# Set number of rollouts and training iterations
num_rollouts = 3
num_training_iters = 50

# Collect initial dataset
X, Y = [], []
for _ in range(num_rollouts):
    x, y = rollout(env, initial_state_dist, num_steps=30)
    X.append(x)
    Y.append(y)
X = np.vstack(X)
Y = np.vstack(Y)

# Create a controller and reward
controller = RbfController(state_dim=state_dim, action_dim=action_dim, num_basis_functions=10)
reward = ExponentialReward(state_dim=state_dim, action_dim=action_dim, t=target)

# Instantiate the model and define the cost
pilco = PILCO((X, Y), controller, reward, horizon=30)
pilco.mgpr.set_data((X, Y))
cost = planar_arm_cost

# Train the model
for i in range(num_training_iters):
    pilco.optimize()
    X_new, Y_new = rollout(env, initial_state_dist, pilco, num_steps=30)
    
    # Update the model with new data
    X = np.vstack((X, X_new))
    Y = np.vstack((Y, Y_new))
    pilco.mgpr.set_data((X, Y))

    # Report progress
    r = cost.compute_reward(X_new[:, :state_dim], None)[0]
    print(f"Iteration {i + 1}: Reward {np.sum(r):.2f}")
```
