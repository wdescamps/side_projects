#  Soft Actor
**Model Type:**  Music Generation Models
**Data Type:**  Audio Data

**Python code **:


```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from sac_agent import SACAgent

"""
Assume we have created a SACAgent class using the code from the GitHub repository
mentioned in the resources above.
We also assume that we have an environment object called 'env' with continuous
action space and observations.
"""

device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
agent = SACAgent(state_dim=env.observation_space.shape[0],
                 action_dim=env.action_space.shape[0],
                 device=device)

n_episodes = 1000
for i_episode in range(1, n_episodes + 1):
    state = env.reset()
    episode_reward = 0
    done = False
    
    while not done:
        action = agent.select_action(state) 
        next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
        episode_reward += reward
        agent.replay_buffer.add(state, action, next_state, reward, done)
        state = next_state

        # Update SAC networks
        agent.learn()

        if done:
            print(f"Episode {i_episode}, Reward: {episode_reward}")
```

This example demonstrates how to create an SACAgent object that is capable of taking actions in an environment, updating its network based on the experience, and maintaining a dynamic temperature. The full implementation of the SACAgent class and related functions can be found in the linked GitHub repository.
