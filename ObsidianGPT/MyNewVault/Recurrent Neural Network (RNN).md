**Data Type**: Text Data

**Description**:

Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a type of neural network that is ideal for processing sequential data, like text, speech, and time-series data. In contrast to feedforward neural networks, which are limited to processing fixed-length inputs, RNN can process inputs of any length. In an RNN, information is passed from one time-step to another, giving the model the ability to identify patterns in sequential data.

In the case of text data, RNNs can be used to model sequential dependencies between words in a sentence or document. Each word in the sequence is represented by a vector, and the hidden states of the RNN are updated at each time-step as it processes the input sequence. This means that the RNN can take into account the context of each word when making predictions.

One of the best use cases for RNNs in text data is language modeling. Language modeling involves processing text data and predicting the next word in a sequence. For example, given the sentence "I want to eat some", a language model using an RNN can predict the next word could be "pizza", "burger", "fries", etc. Another use case for RNNs in text data is sentiment analysis, which involves classifying a text as positive, negative, or neutral based on its content. 

Overall, RNNs are an excellent tool for processing sequential data, like text, and are particularly useful for language modeling and sentiment analysis tasks.
