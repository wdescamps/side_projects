**Data Type**: Numerical Data

**Description**:

Linear regression is a statistical model that is used to predict a continuous numerical outcome based on one or more input variables. It is a simple linear approach that can be used to examine the relationship between two variables. 

The best use case for linear regression is when there is a clear linear relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variable(s). It is useful when we want to predict a continuous outcome or when we want to understand the relationship between two continuous variables. 

Some examples of using linear regression include:

1. Predicting sales of a product based on advertising expenditure, product price, and other factors.

2. Analyzing the relationship between temperature and crop yield to predict the yield for a given year.

3. Determining the impact of education level on salary by analyzing the relationship between these two variables.

Linear regression can provide a simple yet effective way to analyze the relationship between different variables. However, it is important to keep in mind that linear regression assumes a linear relationship between variables and may not always be the best choice for more complex datasets.
