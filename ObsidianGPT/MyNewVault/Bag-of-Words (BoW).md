**Data Type**: Text Data

**Description**:

The Bag-of-Words (BoW) model is a technique in Natural Language Processing (NLP) used for text classification, and sentiment analysis. In BoW, the text data is first pre-processed by removing stop words, punctuations, and reducing the words to their root form. Then, the model converts the pre-processed text into a vector of numerical values.

In BoW, a document is represented as a bag of its words, disregarding grammar and word order but keeping the frequency of each word in the text data. This is done by creating a vocabulary of unique words from the input text data and then creating a vector of word counts for each document.

A simple example would be: 
If given a sentence "The cat in the hat.", the BoW model would create a vector of [1, 1, 1, 1] since there is one occurrence of each of the words 'the', 'cat', 'in', and 'hat' in the sentence. 

The best use case for BoW is when the text data has a large vocabulary of words and when the task is to perform text classification, sentiment analysis, or text-based clustering. It is also used in recommendation systems where text data is present in the form of product reviews or descriptions. The BoW model, despite its simplicity, has shown to be very effective in many text-based applications.
