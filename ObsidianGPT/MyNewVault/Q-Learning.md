**Data Type**: Reinforcement Learning

**Description**:

The Q-learning model is a type of Reinforcement Learning algorithm that aims to estimate the maximum amount of reward that a particular action can generate in a given environment. It does this by creating a matrix called a Q-table, which lists all possible actions and rewards in a given environment. The Q-table is then updated during the learning process as the agent interacts with the environment.

The Q-learning model is best used in situations where the agent must make a sequence of decisions, each of which affects the outcome of the subsequent decision. For example, in game playing, the agent must choose a sequence of moves that lead to a win while avoiding losses. In robotics, the agent must make a sequence of decisions that enable it to navigate an unknown environment.

The Q-learning model is particularly useful in Reinforcement Learning data because it does not require the agent to have prior knowledge of the environment or the optimal actions to take. Instead, through the iterative process of trial and error, the agent is able to learn the optimal action to take in each state of the environment. This makes it ideal for applications where the optimal solution is unknown and must be discovered through experience.
