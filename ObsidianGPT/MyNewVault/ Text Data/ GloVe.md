#  GloVe
**Model Type:**  Natural Language Processing Models
**Data Type:**  Text Data

**Python code **:


```python
import numpy as np
from gensim.scripts.glove2word2vec import glove2word2vec
from gensim.models.keyedvectors import KeyedVectors

# Convert GloVe file to word2vec format.
glove_input_file = 'glove.6B.100d.txt'
word2vec_output_file = 'word2vec_glove.6B.100d.txt'
glove2word2vec(glove_input_file, word2vec_output_file)

# Load the GloVe model.
model = KeyedVectors.load_word2vec_format(word2vec_output_file)

# Retrieve the embeddings and perform similarity analysis.
word1 = 'apple'
word2 = 'banana'
vector1 = model[word1]
vector2 = model[word2]
cosine_similarity = np.dot(vector1, vector2) / (np.linalg.norm(vector1) * np.linalg.norm(vector2))

print(f"Similarity between '{word1}' and '{word2}': {cosine_similarity}")
```

Note: The code assumes that you have downloaded the GloVe pre-trained embeddings ("glove.6B.100d.txt") from the official website (https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/).
