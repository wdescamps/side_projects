#  Word2Vec
**Model Type:**  Natural Language Processing Models
**Data Type:**  Text Data

**Python code **:


```python
import gensim.downloader as api

# Load pre-trained word2vec model
model = api.load("word2vec-google-news-300")

# Find the most similar words to 'dog'
similar_words = model.most_similar("dog")

print(similar_words)

# Find the cosine similarity between word vectors
similarity = model.similarity("cat", "dog")
print(similarity)

# Analogical reasoning using word vectors (e.g., King - Male + Female = ?)
result = model.most_similar(positive=["king", "female"], negative=["male"], topn=1)
print(result)
```

This code loads a pre-trained Word2Vec model (trained on the Google News dataset) using the Gensim library, then demonstrates finding most similar words, calculating similarity, and performing analogical reasoning.
