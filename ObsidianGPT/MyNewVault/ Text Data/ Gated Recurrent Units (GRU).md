**Model Type:**  Natural Language Processing Models
**Data Type:**  Text Data

## Use Cases :

a. Language modeling: GRUs can be used for predicting the next word in a sequence or generating text given a specific context, thus helping in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

b. Time series prediction: GRUs can be used to model time-dependent data, such as stock prices, weather data, or sensor data, making accurate predictions on future values.

c. Speech recognition: Due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies in sequences, GRUs can be employed in speech recognition systems, where they can model the temporal dynamics of audio signals for improved transcription accuracy.


## Python code: 

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Embedding, GRU, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer

# Sample text data
sentences = ["I like apples.", "I like oranges.", "He likes bananas.", "She likes grapes."]

# Tokenize sentences
tokenizer = Tokenizer(num_words=100)
tokenizer.fit_on_texts(sentences)
word_index = tokenizer.word_index
sequences = np.array(tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(sentences))

# Prepare input and output for the GRU model
input_sequences = sequences[:, :-1]
labels = sequences[:, -1]

# Define a simple GRU model
model = Sequential([
    Embedding(input_dim=100, output_dim=32, input_length=2),
    GRU(units=16),
    Dense(units=len(word_index)+1, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(input_sequences, labels, epochs=100)
```

This example demonstrates the use of the GRU model for simple text classification using TensorFlow. The model takes a sequence of words, maps them into an embedding space, and feeds them into a GRU layer, followed by a dense layer to produce the final output.
