**Data Type**: Image Data

**Description**:

Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) is a type of deep learning model that consists of two neural networks: a generator and a discriminator. The generator generates new data samples, while the discriminator checks whether the generated data is real or fake. These two networks are trained together in a process called adversarial training, where the generator learns to create better samples, while the discriminator learns to become more effective at identifying fake samples.

GANs are best used for image data, as they are particularly good at generating realistic images. They have been used for a variety of applications, such as for creating art, generating synthetic data for training machine learning models, and even creating realistic human faces.

One notable example of GANs use case for image data is in the field of fashion. Through GAN-generated fashion designs, designers could save costs on fabrics and other materials by creating virtual samples. The designs produced by GANs can be altered to create an infinite number of variations with real-world accuracy while saving production time. Recent efforts by DeepDream, an AI-generated fashion line, have resulted in successful lines ranging from streetwear to high fashion. 

Overall, GANs represent a powerful tool in the AI and machine learning toolkit for image data and are increasingly being leveraged to create realistic images that replicate aspects of the natural world more and more convincingly.
