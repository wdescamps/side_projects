**Data Type**: Unstructured Data

**Description**:

t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is a machine learning technique used for visualizing high-dimensional data in a lower dimensional space. It is a non-linear dimensionality reduction technique that maps the data points from high-dimensional space to a two or three-dimensional space.

The t-SNE algorithm aims to preserve the pairwise distance between the data points. It uses a probabilistic approach to map the high-dimensional data points to the 2D or 3D space based on their similarity in the high-dimensional space. It tries to minimize the divergence between the similarity distribution of the high-dimensional data points and the low-dimensional representation of the data points.

The t-SNE algorithm is well suited for visualizing complex and unstructured data sets. It is particularly beneficial for visualizing high-dimensional data sets, such as images, audio, and genomic data. It is used to explore, analyze, and reveal the underlying structure of the data by identifying patterns, clusters, and outliers. t-SNE has been used in various applications such as image recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing, and bioinformatics.

In summary, t-SNE is a powerful dimensionality reduction technique that can reveal hidden structures in complex and unstructured data. Its best use case is for exploratory data analysis and visualization of high-dimensional data sets, where it can provide insights into the underlying patterns and structure of the data.
