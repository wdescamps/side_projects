**Data Type**: Time Series Data

**Description**:

Prophet is a time series forecasting model developed by Facebook's Core Data Science team. It is a robust model that provides easy-to-use tools for time series modeling and forecasting. Prophet is designed to handle different types of seasonality including yearly, weekly, and daily. The model uses a decomposable time series model with three main components: trend, seasonality, and holidays. The model can also accommodate changes in trends and seasonal behaviors over time.

Prophet model is best used for time series data with complex patterns such as seasonality, trends, holidays, and other events that might impact the data. It is particularly useful for long-range forecasting where traditional methods such as ARIMA or Exponential Smoothing may not perform well. Furthermore, Prophet's ability to handle missing values and outliers makes it a preferred tool for time series analysis. Additionally, the Prophet model provides an intuitive interface, making it easy to adjust and tune the model's parameters to achieve improved performance.

In summary, Prophet is an effective time series forecasting model that can handle complex patterns and is easy to use for long-range forecasting with a variety of use cases, including sales forecasting, demand forecasting, inventory management, and capacity planning.
