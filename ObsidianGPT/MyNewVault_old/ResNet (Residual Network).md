**Data Type**: Image Data

**Description**:

ResNet (Residual Network) is a deep learning architecture that was introduced by Microsoft researchers in 2015. ResNet is considered one of the most advanced and powerful models for image recognition tasks such as object detection, image classification, and semantic segmentation.

The ResNet model consists of multiple layers of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) stacked together. It is designed with shortcut connections or skip connections that allow the model to learn and retain the identity function of the input image while simultaneously learning the feature representation. These shortcut connections transfer the representation of one layer directly to deeper layers, enabling it to learn more complex features. This method of residual learning helps to solve the problem of vanishing gradients and improves the training of the model.

The best use case for ResNet is image recognition because of its powerful capabilities for feature extraction and classification. It is widely used in image classification tasks such as identifying image content, detecting edges, and extracting features. ResNet is particularly useful for larger and more complex data sets, such as those in object detection or semantic segmentation tasks, where the model must classify images with multiple objects or complex backgrounds. It is also used in medical imaging analysis, self-driving cars, and facial recognition technology due to its high accuracy and efficiency.
