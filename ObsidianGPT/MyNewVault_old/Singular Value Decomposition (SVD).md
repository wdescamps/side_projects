**Data Type**: Unstructured Data

**Description**:

The Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a matrix factorization technique that breaks down a rectangular matrix into three matrices of a specific form. In other words, SVD takes a matrix and decomposes it into three simpler matrices: 

- A left singular matrix, 
- A diagonal matrix of singular values, and 
- A right singular matrix.

This technique is mainly used for dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, image compression, and data compression. 

In the context of unstructured data, the SVD model is often used for text analysis and natural language processing (NLP). In particular, it is used for document clustering, topic modeling, and semantic analysis. 

The main advantage of using SVD for unstructured data is that it can identify underlying themes or topics within large and complex text datasets. By reducing the number of dimensions through SVD, the performance of unsupervised learning algorithms can be significantly improved.

An example application of SVD for unstructured data is the Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) technique, which uses SVD to identify hidden patterns in texts and then determines the relationships between words and documents by mapping them to a lower-dimensional space. This transformation can then be used to cluster documents based on their similarity or to recommend relevant documents based on user queries.
