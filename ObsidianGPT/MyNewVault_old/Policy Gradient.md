**Data Type**: Reinforcement Learning

**Description**:

The Policy Gradient model is a reinforcement learning algorithm that aims to learn a policy function that maximizes the expected cumulative reward over time. The policy function determines the action to take at each state of the environment. 

The Policy Gradient model is well-suited for Reinforcement Learning data where the state space is continuous and/or high-dimensional, as it does not rely on value function estimation. It works by directly optimizing the policy function through gradient ascent, using the gradient of the expected cumulative reward with respect to the policy parameters. 

One major advantage of the Policy Gradient model is that it can handle stochastic policies, i.e., policies that select actions probabilistically. This can be useful in scenarios where the optimal action might not always be clear-cut, or where exploration is necessary. 

A good use case for the Policy Gradient model is in robotics, where the state space can be high-dimensional and continuous, and the actions taken need to be precise and purposeful. The Policy Gradient model can be used to learn the optimal policy for a robotic agent to successfully navigate and accomplish tasks in its environment.
