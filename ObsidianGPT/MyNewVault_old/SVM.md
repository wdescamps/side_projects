**Data Type**: Categorical Data

**Description**:

Support Vector Machines (SVM) is a machine learning algorithm that is mainly used for classification tasks, especially with complex and high-dimensional datasets. The SVM algorithm essentially separates the data into different categories by creating an optimal hyperplane in a higher-dimensional space. 

For categorical data with multiple classes, SVM can be used as a multi-class classifier by employing a technique called one-vs-rest (OvR) or one-vs-one (OvO). In the OvR approach, we create multiple binary classifiers where each classifier learns to distinguish between one class and the rest of the classes. In the OvO approach, we train N*(N-1)/2 classifiers, where N is the number of classes. Each classifier learns to separate two classes, and the final classification is done by majority voting.

The SVM model is particularly effective when there is a clear separation between the classes in the feature space. It is also useful when the number of features is larger than the number of instances, as the SVM can efficiently handle high-dimensional data. Additionally, SVM can handle non-linear data by using kernel functions to transform the input data into higher dimensions.

One of the best use cases of SVM for categorical data is in image classification, natural language processing, and text classification. In these applications, SVM can distinguish between various categories of the data based on the features extracted from the images or text. Also, SVM has been shown to perform effectively in biometric applications such as face recognition and fingerprint identification.
