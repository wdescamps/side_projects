**Data Type**: Time Series Data

**Description**:

The Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model is a variation of the ARIMA model that takes into account seasonal patterns in time series data. SARIMA models are commonly used to forecast and analyze data with a seasonal pattern, such as demand for seasonal products or weekly or monthly financial data.

The SARIMA model combines the non-seasonal ARIMA model with a seasonal component, referred to as the difference between seasonal periods. The SARIMA model calculates the seasonal component of a time series by analyzing the data at regular intervals throughout the year. This process allows the model to account for yearly patterns in the data, such as holidays, quarterly financial reporting periods, or recurring weather patterns.

The SARIMA model is best used when there is a clear seasonal pattern within a time series dataset and when the data is stationary, meaning it is not affected by trends or other non-stationary factors. SARIMA models are particularly effective in situations where forecasting is required to make decisions based on seasonal patterns. For example, the model can be used to predict sales of seasonal goods such as Christmas trees, Halloween costumes, or summer clothing. Overall, the SARIMA model is a powerful tool for analyzing and predicting complex time series data with seasonal patterns.
