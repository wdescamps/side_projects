**Data Type**: Text Data

**Description**:

Word2Vec is a popular language modeling technique that is used to represent words in a vector format, which is also known as word embedding. In this model, words are represented in dense vectors of fixed-length. The model uses a neural network that learns to predict the probability of a word given its context words. It comprises of two architectures, namely:

1. Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW): Here, the model predicts a word based on its surrounding context. For instance, given a sentence, "The cat is sleeping on the mat," CBOW will predict the word 'sleeping' when provided with the context words 'The cat is on the mat.'

2. Skip-Gram: Here, the model predicts the context words surrounding a given target word. E.g., given a sentence "The cat is sleeping on the mat," Skip-Gram predicts the context words 'The', 'cat', 'is', 'on', and 'the' given the target word 'sleeping.'

The best use case for Text Data for Word2Vec is in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The technique can be used for a variety of tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, machine translation, and information extraction. Word2Vec allows these processes to be accomplished more accurately and quickly than other traditional NLP methods. Furthermore, it is useful in identifying relationships within words, synonyms, and antonyms, thereby making it efficient for finding similar or opposite words. It is also used in recommending related content to the users and is widely used in search engines, chatbots, recommender systems, and other NLP tasks.
