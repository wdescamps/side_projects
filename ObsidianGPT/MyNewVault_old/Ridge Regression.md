**Model Type**: Regression

**Data Type**: Numerical

**Python code **:


```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_boston
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Load the dataset
data = load_boston()
X = data.data
y = data.target

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Create and fit the Ridge Regression model
ridge = Ridge(alpha=1.0)  # alpha is the regularization strength
ridge.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions and calculate metrics
y_pred = ridge.predict(X_test)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)

print("Mean Squared Error:", mse)
```
This Python code demonstrates how to use the Ridge Regression model using the scikit-learn library on the Boston Housing dataset. The model is trained with an alpha value of 1.0 and the Mean Squared Error (MSE) is calculated for the predictions on the test dataset.
