**Data Type**: Image Data

**Description**:

Faster R-CNN is a convolutional neural network (CNN) based object detection model that uses region proposal networks (RPNs) to efficiently generate region of interest proposals. The model consists of three main components: a shared convolutional network that extracts features from an input image, a region proposal network that generates candidate object bounding boxes, and a detection network that classifies the proposals and refines the bounding boxes.

The best use case for Faster R-CNN model is object detection in images. For instance, it can be used in security surveillance systems to detect and track intruders, in medical imaging to detect cancerous cells, and in self-driving cars for object detection on roads to avoid accidents. The model's ability to efficiently generate region proposals and accurately classify objects make it a powerful tool for various computer vision tasks.
