**Data Type**: Reinforcement Learning

**Description**:

The Dueling Network Architecture for Deep Reinforcement Learning (Dueling DQN) model is a neural network architecture used in deep reinforcement learning. It separates the estimation of the value of a state-action pair and the advantage of taking that action in that state. 

In traditional Q-learning models, the Q-value of a state-action pair is calculated as the sum of the expected future rewards and the reward received at that state-action pair. In Dueling DQN, a state-value function and an advantage function are estimated separately to calculate the Q-value of a state-action pair. The state-value function estimates the general value of being in a particular state, while the advantage function estimates the additional value of taking a specific action in that state.

The best use case for Dueling DQN is in domains where some actions do not have a significant effect on the environment, while others have a significant effect. It is also particularly useful in high-dimensional state spaces, where a large number of state-action pairs may lead to convergence issues with traditional Q-learning models. By separating the value and advantage functions, Dueling DQN is able to more efficiently estimate the Q-value of each state-action pair, leading to faster convergence and better performance in these types of domains.
